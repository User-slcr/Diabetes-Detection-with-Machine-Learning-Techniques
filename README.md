# Diabetes Detection with Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust diabetes detection system using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify patients into three categories: **Diabetic**, **Non-Diabetic**, and **Predicted-Diabetic**. We employ and compare the performance of seven different machine learning algorithms on a dataset comprising over 1000 patient records.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of over 1000 patients and includes various features relevant to diabetes diagnosis. Each record is labeled as one of the following:
- **Diabetic**: Patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes.
- **Non-Diabetic**: Patients who do not have diabetes.
- **Predicted-Diabetic**: Patients who are predicted to have diabetes based on the model.

### Dataset Features

- **Patient ID**: Unique identifier for each patient
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure
- **Glucose Level**: Blood glucose level
- **Insulin**: Insulin level
- **Skin Thickness**: Skin fold thickness
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies

## Machine Learning Algorithms

We implement and evaluate the following machine learning algorithms:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forests**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
6. **Naive Bayes**
7. **Gradient Boosting**

Each algorithm is trained and tested on the dataset to compare their performance in detecting diabetes.

## Performance Evaluation

The performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive instances out of the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positive instances out of the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Results are presented in a comparative analysis to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in the context of diabetes detection.
